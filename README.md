# CodeHelper
Code helper is a basic windows form that helps you convert data from your clipboard to usefull code that you can later on paste.
## Rule of 5
Bored of writing these all the time after creating your class?
```cpp
ExampleClass(const ExampleClass& other) = delete;
ExampleClass(ExampleClass&& other) = delete;
ExampleClass& operator=(const ExampleClass& other) = delete;
ExampleClass& operator=(ExampleClass&& other) = delete;
```
Well don't worry because there is a short cut for it now.
### Usage
1. Copy the name of the class
2. Use the shortcut **LCTRL + 5**
3. Paste and see the magic
